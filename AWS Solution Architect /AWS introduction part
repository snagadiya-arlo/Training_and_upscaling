## 🏗️ AWS Infrastructure

### 🔹 AWS Global Infrastructure
> The complete worldwide network of AWS data centers that deliver secure, scalable, and low-latency cloud services.

### 🔹 AWS Regions
> Geographically separate locations around the world where AWS clusters its data centers to provide services close to users.

### 🔹 AWS Availability Zones (AZs)
> Multiple isolated data center groups within a Region, designed for high availability and fault tolerance.

### 🔹 AWS Data Centers
> Physical facilities housing servers, storage, and networking hardware that power AWS services.

### 🔹 AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence
> AWS locations closer to end-users that accelerate content delivery through **CloudFront (CDN)** and reduce latency.

🖥️ Tour of the AWS Console
🌐 Global Services

(These services are not tied to a specific region — they are global by nature.)

IAM (Identity and Access Management) – Manages users, roles, and access permissions.

Route 53 – Global DNS and traffic routing service.

CloudFront – Content Delivery Network (CDN) service for low-latency content delivery.

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) – Protects applications from common web threats.

🏢 Region-Scoped Services

(These services are provisioned inside a selected AWS Region.)

Amazon EC2 (Compute) – Virtual servers running applications (IaaS).

Elastic Beanstalk (Platform Deployment) – Deploy and manage applications without managing infrastructure (PaaS).

AWS Lambda (Serverless Compute) – Run code without provisioning servers (FaaS).

Amazon Rekognition (AI/ML) – Image and video analysis using machine learning (SaaS).

🌎 How to Choose an AWS Region

Compliance & Data Residency – Choose a region based on legal or regulatory requirements; data stays in that region.

Latency & Proximity to Users – Select the region closest to your customers for fastest response times.

Service Availability – Not all AWS services are available in every region; newer services launch in select regions first.

Cost Considerations – Pricing varies by region; selecting a lower-cost region can reduce overall spending.
